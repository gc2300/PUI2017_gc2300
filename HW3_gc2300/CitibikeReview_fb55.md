** Null and Alternative hypothesis **

The null is formulated consistently with the idea. The confidence level should be referred to as *significance* level.

The Null/ALt should also be expressed as mathmatical forulate

** Data **

The data seems parsed correctly. THe plots should help give an insight into the queation/analysis, but they re hard to read since the distributions appear to have outliers at the tail (4000 hour minute?)

THe plots should also be made for clean distributions where outliers are removed. Indicating the location of the mean above each histogram would also help visualization

** Test **
Since you are testing means the easiest tests are z. Slightly more sophysticated would be an ANOVA Both of these though are parametric and the assumption of notmality likely does not hold here, seeing the shape of the distribution (ANOVA assumes normality of the residuals, also not guaranteed). A  nMann Whitney U test does not assume normality and it is also a powerful test

** Other suggestions **
make sure to motivate why the question is interesting
